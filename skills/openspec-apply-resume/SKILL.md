Review an in-progress OpenSpec change implementation, run static analysis and validation checks, fix any issues found, and continue applying remaining tasks.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Resuming change: <name>" and how to override.

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)
   - Which artifacts exist for this change

3. **Get context and instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - Context file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using openspec-propose or openspec-review-proposal to complete/refine the planning artifacts
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest running openspec-test, then openspec-align if testing reveals proposal drift, then openspec-archive-change
   - Otherwise: proceed to review and implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read all files listed in `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Examine the codebase to verify current implementation status**

   - Use Glob and Grep to find files mentioned in the proposal/tasks
   - Read relevant files to understand what has been implemented
   - Check git status to see modified/untracked files
   - Parse the tasks.md to identify which tasks are marked complete vs incomplete

6. **Analyze implementation status and provide a summary**

   Display:
   - What has been done correctly
   - What is incomplete or missing
   - What has been done but has issues (bugs, wrong API usage, etc.)
   - What has been done but can be improved
   - Any deviation from the spec or design

7. **Run validation checks to identify issues**

   **Static Analysis (project-specific):**

   Detect project type and run appropriate static analysis:
   - **Flutter**: `flutter analyze`
   - **Python**: `ruff check`, `mypy`, or `pylint`
   - **Node.js/TypeScript**: `eslint`, `tsc --noEmit`
   - **Go**: `go vet`, `golangci-lint run`
   - **Rust**: `cargo clippy`, `cargo check`
   - **Java**: `mvn compile` or `gradle build` with analysis plugins
   - **Other**: Run any linter configured in the project (check package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, build.gradle, etc.)

   **OpenSpec Validation:**

   ```bash
   openspec validate <name> --strict
   ```

   Report all issues found with:
   - Issue type (static analysis or spec validation)
   - Severity (error, warning, info)
   - File path and line number (if available)
   - Description of the issue

8. **Fix identified issues**

   For each issue found:
   - Fix code errors, warnings, or bugs
   - Complete any missing implementation
   - Improve suboptimal code (if warranted)

   **Guardrails:**
   - Only write code to fix identified issues or complete remaining tasks
   - Avoid over-engineering or adding features not specified
   - Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome in the proposal

9. **Validate fixes**

   - Re-run the appropriate static analysis command to confirm no new issues
   - Re-run `openspec validate <name> --strict` to confirm compliance

10. **Continue implementing remaining tasks**

    If tasks remain incomplete after fixing issues:
    - Read tasks.md to identify remaining unchecked tasks
    - Implement each remaining task one by one
    - Make code changes required
    - Keep changes minimal and focused
    - Mark each task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`

    **Pause if:**
    - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
    - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
    - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
    - User interrupts

11. **Update tasks.md**

    After all fixes and remaining tasks are complete:
    - Mark completed tasks as `- [x]`
    - Mark tasks that still need work as `- [ ]`
    - Add notes for any tasks requiring manual testing or documentation

12. **Provide final summary**

    Display:
    - What was fixed or completed in this session
    - Tasks completed this session
    - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
    - Remaining tasks that require manual action (testing, documentation, etc.)
    - If all done: suggest running openspec-test, then openspec-align if testing reveals proposal drift, then openspec-archive-change

**Guardrails**

- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome in the proposal
- Only write code to fix identified issues or complete remaining tasks—avoid over-engineering or adding features not specified
- Always run static analysis appropriate to the project type
- Always run `openspec validate --strict` to confirm spec compliance
- Validate fixes by re-running analysis and validation commands
- Update tasks.md checkboxes after completing each task
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "review and resume" workflow:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: After partial implementation, when validation issues need fixing, or to continue with remaining tasks
- **Supports validation-driven workflow**: Runs static analysis and OpenSpec validation to identify issues before continuing
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts—not phase-locked, work fluidly
- **Tracks progress explicitly**: Updates tasks.md checkboxes and provides detailed progress summaries

**Output Format**

Use clear markdown with sections for each analysis step:

```
## Resuming Change: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)
